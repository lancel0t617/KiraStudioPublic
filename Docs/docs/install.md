# Installation

## System requirements

For all 3 desktop platforms, FamiStudio requires the following software/hardware environment:

* Windows 8 (64-bit) or newer
* MacOS 10.15 "Catalina" or newer
* OpenGL 3.0 support or newer

## Windows

On Windows, it is highly recommended to get it from the Windows Store as it will take care of all dependencies and the app will be signed by Microsoft, removing any anti-virus warnings. 

Otherwise, if you really want to use the portable EXE version, if you are getting a Visual Studio C++ Runtime error message, be sure to install the following package.

* [Visual Studio Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

On first launch of the portable version, SmartScreen might say "Windows protected your PC".

To bypass the warning, simply click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway".
