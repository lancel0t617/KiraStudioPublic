# Generators Reference

This page contains some reference on all the generators present in the app. Generators are little modules able to produce one type of sound and are the building blocks of instruments.

For generators emulating actual hardware, some notes about the emulation accuracy will be provided for each.

Please note that in-general, for these retro consoles, this app is not trying to achieve high-accuracy emulation. It provides users with a lot of "fakebit" freedoms such as unlimited ROM space and enhanced polyphony. Thereform some compromises are made to strike a balance between fidelity and ease-of-use. 

For accurate emulation, trackers and other dedicated tools should be used.

# Generic

The generic generators are basic synths provided with the app. They do not try to emulate any particular device. They are meant easy to use and customizable. 

This list will likely grow in future versions.
